# Markdown-notes
Markdown is a simple markup language (i.e. language for formatting text) that you can use to format virtually any document, and have it seamlessly converted to HTML. With Markdown, you donâ€™t click buttons to bold or italicise words and phrases. Instead, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.
