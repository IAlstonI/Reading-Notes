# Loops
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 
This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.
You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another
For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:
The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:
**for statement
do...while statement
while statement
labeled statement
break statement
continue statement
for...in statement
for...of statement**

## Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Arithmetic operators
Bitwise operators
Logical operators
String operators
Conditional (ternary) operator
Comma operator

JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.
A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.
